# Puddle's guest CA bundle: the image's own CA bundle with Puddle's extra CAs appended
# (the host's corporate and user-added roots, Puddle's own CAs), every certificate once.
# SSL_CERT_FILE, REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE and CURL_CA_BUNDLE point at the result, so tools that take
# a bundle path keep the distro roots: append, never replace.
#
# boot.sh runs this as a plan step at every boot, after update-ca-certificates (which has then
# already added the extra CAs to the system bundle; they are not added twice). The bundle file is
# rewritten only when its contents change. POSIX sh; needs awk to drop duplicates (without awk
# the bundle is still complete, only possibly with a certificate twice).
#
# PUDDLE_ROOT relocates every path, for the unit tests only (boot.sh passes it on empty).
