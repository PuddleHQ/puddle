//! One workspace's captured logins: what the token endpoints answer, what is kept, what the
//! workspace holds instead.
//!
//! The workspace's tool logs in as it always does. When the token endpoint of a profile answers
//! with tokens, the real ones go to the operating system's credential store and the answer the
//! tool receives carries stand-ins with the tokens' shape. When the tool refreshes, it sends the
//! stand-in of its refresh token; the proxy swaps the real one into that one field of the request
//! ([`puddle_proxy::Exchange::swapping`]) and the new answer is captured the same way, behind the
//! same stand-in: a stand-in names a slot (a profile's role in this workspace), so a refresh
//! changes the real token behind it and nothing the tool has stored.
//!
//! Where the stand-ins are swapped back is the proxy's ([`puddle_proxy::StandIns`]): in the headers
//! of requests to the profile's hosts, and nowhere else.
//!
//! If a login cannot be captured (the answer is not in a form Puddle reads, the token is bound to
//! a key, the credential store is not there) the answer goes to the tool as it is, so the tool
//! keeps working, and the user is told that this login is not protected.
