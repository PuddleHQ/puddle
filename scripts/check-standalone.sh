# Two pattern sets (ERE). `ids` is matched case-insensitively, `exact` is case-sensitive.
# `B`/`E` stand in for word boundaries, because `_` and `-` count as separators in names like
# `puddle-t165-lab` or `d37_name` (grep's \b would treat `_` as part of the word).
#   ids:   T-<n> and D-<n> with any number of digits, W-<n>, a bare t<3-4 digits> (t165,
#          PUDDLE_T144_X), and a d<2-3 digits>_ test-name prefix (d37_toggle).
#   exact: MWE, W1..W9, workspace names and files.
# Not seen: an ID spelled out ("task 165"), one split by punctuation, a bare t/d number with other
# digit counts (t42, d4; they collide with timers and NTLM "T1"/"T3"), or any reference that is
# worded rather than numbered. Those need the read-through review, not this gate.
