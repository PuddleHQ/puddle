# The quality gates, in one place: git hooks, CI and humans all run this script, so the gates
# can't drift apart. Usage: scripts/check.sh <gate>...   Gates:
#   fmt, typos, spdx, shellcheck, hooks, git-env, platform-literals, standalone, git-pins, silent-skips, quality, secrets, clippy, clippy-windows, deny, advisories, notices, openapi, test, doc, coverage,
#   coverage-ratchet, diff-coverage, coverage-determinism, mutants,
#   ui, ui-licences, ui-audit, ui-e2e
#   fast     = fmt typos spdx shellcheck hooks platform-literals standalone git-pins silent-skips   (pre-commit hook)
#   all      = fast quality git-env secrets clippy clippy-windows deny advisories notices openapi ui ui-licences ui-audit ui-e2e doc coverage
#              (CI, the nightly run, by hand; coverage runs the tests, and must follow `ui`: the embedded UI is built there)
#   pre-push = every gate of `all` except ui-e2e, the slowest one, and advisories and ui-audit, which depend on
#              the day's advisory databases and not on the change (pre-push hook; CI still runs ui-e2e after the push)
#   `scripts/check.sh --list <set>` prints a set's gates, one per line, without running anything.
# Several gates run at the same time (scripts/gate-sched.sh): after the `fast` gates, which run first and
# stop the run on a failure, the compile-and-test gates, the UI chain (ui ui-licences ui-audit ui-e2e) and
# secrets/deny/notices are three streams; coverage waits for `ui`. Each gate's output is printed whole under
# its `==> <gate>` line when it finishes; a failure in any stream fails the run (first failure in run order,
# its exit status). PUDDLE_CHECK_SERIAL=1 runs them one by one, as before. A gate set that fits one stream
# runs inline and prints live. The `notices` gate is skipped when its inputs are byte for byte those of a
# passing run (CHECK_NO_SKIP=1 runs it anyway); CI keeps that stamp in a cache entry (CHECK_STAMP_DIR, --stamp-key).
# The ui gates need Node 24 (the UI's package-lock.json pins every npm package). ui-e2e also needs
# the Playwright browsers: `cd ui && npx playwright install --with-deps chromium webkit`.
# Set CARGO to run every Cargo command through a wrapper, e.g. CARGO=mbx for the shared build
# cache (docs/STANDARDS.md, "Shared build cache"); unset, it runs plain cargo. The coverage gates
# ignore it: they always run plain cargo (see `plain_cargo` below).
# Coverage (docs/STANDARDS.md, "Coverage"): the floors live here, the ratchet baseline in
# scripts/coverage-baseline.json; raise them, never lower them without the owner's OK. The ratchet
# lets a total measure up to 0.05 points below its baseline (run-to-run wobble); the floors are exact.
# The crates in scripts/full-coverage-crates.txt must keep every line covered (gate `coverage`).
# A change's added lines must also be covered (gates `coverage` for Rust, `ui` for the UI,
# `diff-coverage` by hand); DIFF_BASE names the commit to measure from (CI sets it to the PR or push
# base), else the merge base with origin/develop.
