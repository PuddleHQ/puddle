//! The host: one start-up sequence and one shutdown sequence for the whole process.
//!
//! Starting has two phases because one step has to run before the process has any other thread:
//!
//! 1. [`prepare`] (synchronous): bind the image-pull proxy, pin the process environment, check
//!    the bundled runtime, read the corporate roots.
//! 2. [`Host::start`] (asynchronous): open the store, build the egress chain, open the runtime,
//!    reconcile with what an earlier run left, start the proxies and background tasks, build the
//!    workspace service and serve the API last, so nothing can call a half-built host.
//!
//! Every step is recorded as a [`Step`], in order, so tests (and a log reader) can see the
//! sequence that ran.
