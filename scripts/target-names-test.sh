# Checks that no target of a workspace crate (an integration test, bin, example or bench) is named
# like a dependency from the registry or git. `cargo llvm-cov` clears the workspace's old build
# output before each run by file name (`deps/<target>-*`, `deps/lib<target>-*`), so a test target
# `http` also cleared the `http` crate's build, and every crate that depends on it (hyper, axum,
# reqwest, tonic, tauri, microsandbox, 29 to 47 crates) was compiled again on every coverage run.
# Names are compared with `-` and `_` treated as the same, because that is how the files are named.
# Not seen: a target whose name comes from a path cargo discovers outside the layouts below
# (`[[test]] path = ...` is found by its `name`), and a target of a crate outside `crates/`.
# usage: scripts/target-names-test.sh [root]   (default: the repository; `--self-test` checks the check)
