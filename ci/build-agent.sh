# Builds the guest agent (crates/puddle-agent) as a static Linux binary, linked with the toolchain's
# own rust-lld so it runs in any guest image (glibc or musl) and builds the same on a Linux or a
# Windows host (no C toolchain needed). The guest architecture is the host's (msb runs guests of
# its own architecture): PUDDLE_GUEST_ARCH selects it, default x86_64, the only one built and
# tested today. The targets repeat puddle_runtime::GuestArch::agent_target (a unit test keeps the
# two equal).
# Prints the binary's path on stdout; the VM tests take it from PUDDLE_AGENT_BIN.
# Usage: [PUDDLE_GUEST_ARCH=x86_64|aarch64] ci/build-agent.sh [cargo args...]   e.g. ci/build-agent.sh --locked
