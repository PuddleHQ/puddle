//! The real [`WorkspaceService`]: workspaces on the sandbox runtime.
//!
//! A call checks the request, marks the workspace busy, returns it, and a task owned by the
//! service does the work, reporting each step as an event (the contract of
//! [`WorkspaceService`]). The work is `puddle-workspace` (volumes, holders, trim, delete check),
//! `puddle-boot` (the boot hook and its gate), the egress route of `puddle-proxy` and the SSH
//! endpoint of `puddle-ssh`; the sandboxes are handed to the [`Lifecycle`] so they are trimmed
//! and stopped when the host exits.
//!
//! A sandbox boots from the spec it was created with, and that spec holds the endpoint of its
//! egress route, which only lives as long as this process. So a stopped workspace starts again in
//! the same sandbox only while this process still serves that route; otherwise (after a restart
//! of the host) its sandbox is rebuilt on the same volume. Everything on the volume survives,
//! the root disk does not (ADR 0006, point 3).
//!
//! The workspace list on disk is what the next start keeps volumes for, so it is saved before
//! anything it must cover exists or goes: a create is refused when its entry can't be written,
//! a create whose final save fails is undone before anyone works in it, and a delete is refused
//! when the entry can't be taken out first (principle 7, "your work is never lost by accident").
