# Self-test of the concurrent gate runner (scripts/gate-sched.sh) with stub gates, and of the skip of
# the `notices` gate (scripts/check.sh, with a stub cargo in a scratch repository). What it checks:
# gates of different streams overlap; each gate's output stays whole under its `==> <gate>` line;
# any failing stream fails the run with the earliest failed gate's status and log last; a stream
# stops at its first failure; a gate that needs another waits for it and is skipped when it failed;
# PUDDLE_CHECK_SERIAL=1 and a single stream run inline in order; the serial prefix stops the run.
# What it cannot see: real gates (each has its own CI step), the timing of a loaded host (the
# overlap check allows generous slack), a signal reaching the gates' children.
