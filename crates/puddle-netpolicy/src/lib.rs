//! The destination guard: which destinations a workspace may reach, decided
//! before any connection. Pure policy, no network I/O; the proxy (`puddle-proxy`) calls it.
//!
//! | Stage | Item | What |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | name | [`normalise_host`], [`Target`] | strict normal form: lower case, IDNA to ASCII, LDH labels, canonical IP literals; non-canonical numbers refused |
//! | name | [`NetPolicy::check_target`] | literals and `localhost`/metadata names blocked before the rules, so a block never becomes a pending row |
//! | address | [`classify_ip`], [`AddressClass`] | public, a [`LocalCategory`] (with the rule that put it there), or one of Puddle's own endpoints |
//! | address | [`NetPolicy::check_address`], [`AddressVerdict`] | allow, exact-allow only (toggle on), or block naming the toggle |
//! | settings | [`LocalAccess`], [`LocalAccessSource`] | one workspace's toggles and "wildcards reach local addresses", from `puddle-settings` |
//! | endpoints | [`PuddleEndpoints`], [`EndpointKind`] | the registry every Puddle listener joins when it binds |
//! | message | [`block_message`] | the `403` text: what was found and which toggle would allow it; for SSH, the refusal and (on a Git host) the HTTPS form of the remote |
//!
//! The rules it applies:
//!
//! - **Local destinations** are not forbidden, only off by default: one toggle per
//!   [`LocalCategory`], with a global default and a per-workspace override.
//! - **A toggle only *permits* its category;** the destination still needs an allow rule
//!   or an approval.
//! - **Exact allows (R-14):** with the toggle on, only an **exact** allow (of the name, or of the
//!   address itself) reaches a local address; a wildcard (suffix) allow doesn't, unless
//!   "wildcards reach local addresses" is on ([`AddressVerdict::ExactOnly`]).
//! - **Puddle's own listeners** are their own class, blocked whatever the toggles say.
//! - A blocked request names the toggle that would allow it ([`block_message`]).
