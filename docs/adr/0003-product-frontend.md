# 0003 — Product frontend: Svelte 5, decided on the product's requirements

Date: 2026-08-20
Status: accepted; **amended by [0004](0004-api-contract.md)** — the Svelte decision stands, but the
contract tool is OpenAPI-first (utoipa → openapi-typescript/openapi-fetch), not `ts-rs`.
**Amended 2026-10-05**: decision 3 ("the first milestone gets no UI at all") no longer holds; the
first milestone now includes the product UI. See
[the amendment](#amendment-2026-10-05-the-first-milestone-includes-the-product-ui) at the end. The
decisions above it stand as written on 2026-08-20.
**Amended 2026-10-06**: no upstream code is copied or reimplemented; the ~320 copied and ~780
reimplemented LOC in "Consequences" are dropped, the nine lessons stand. See
[the amendment](#amendment-2026-10-06-written-fresh-no-huddle-material).
Amends: [0001](0001-frontend-stack.md) (the "defer the SPA question" part),
[0002](0002-wire-format-and-types.md) (the "no type tooling needed" reading)

## The correction that produced this ADR

ADRs 0001 and 0002 argued from the first milestone: five screens, server-rendered, therefore no
framework decision and no type generation. That is backwards. **The first milestone is a prototype
that validates plumbing —
microVM lifecycle, the vsock chokepoint, policy enforcement, SSH attach. It is not a small version
of the product and it sets no precedent.** Decisions about the shipped application have to be
argued from the shipped application's requirements.

Rule going forward: if a claim in a design document depends on the first milestone's shape, it is
not a design decision, it is a prototype detail.

## What the product's frontend actually has to carry

Not five screens. Taking upstream's real surface, minus what the runtime boundary deletes, plus what
this architecture adds:

- **Workspaces**: list and per-workspace detail with tabs; create/start/stop; **one-click attach**,
  which is the single most-used action in the product.
- **Approvals**: a pending inbox with the four-outcome interaction (allow/deny × this
  workspace/everyone), plus allow-exact-path once path rules land. Live, and it must not be a page
  someone has to be looking at.
- **Firewall**: global and per-workspace rules, permanent and time-bound, path-mode subpaths —
  tables with filtering, editing and expiry.
- **Audit / network log**: a long, growing, filterable, searchable stream. This is the product's
  trust surface, so it needs real table behaviour, not a `<pre>` block.
- **Terminal**: xterm, per workspace.
- **Settings**: bind mounts (upstream's folder mappings), images, runtime pin, theme.
- **Snapshots** and **extensions**: later, but they are screens, not footnotes.

That is eight to twelve screens with live data, filters, forms, modals and a design language to
maintain — an application, and it will be maintained for years. Server-rendered HTML with a
sprinkle of vanilla JS is the wrong tool for that, and "we might never need an SPA" was an artefact
of measuring the prototype instead of the product.

## Decision

1. **The product frontend is a Svelte 5 SPA**, served by axum (and by Tauri in the desktop shell).
   At product scale every factor that favoured Svelte gets stronger — components you do not write, a
   real testing path, a fast dev loop, no pre-1.0 churn in the layer touched daily — while Dioxus's
   advantages (one language, no Node, shared structs) stay the same size or shrink, because a
   generated contract closes the type gap for a day or two of setup ([ADR
   0004](0004-api-contract.md)).
2. **A generated contract is in from the start**, with the wire conventions of ADR 0002, generated
   output committed, and a CI diff gate. It is not deferred: there is a TypeScript consumer by
   definition now. [ADR 0004](0004-api-contract.md) picks the tool — OpenAPI-first rather than
   `ts-rs`, because the endpoint surface needs checking too, not just payload shapes.
3. **The first milestone gets no UI at all.** Validate approve/deny with `puddle approve <id>` /
   `puddle deny <id>` on the CLI plus the JSONL audit stream. That is honest about what the
   prototype is for, it removes 2–3 days of throwaway UI, and it makes it impossible for prototype
   scaffolding to become the product's frontend by inertia.
4. **Dioxus stays recorded as the road not taken**, with its trigger: if this product ever has to
   run without a Node toolchain in the build — an air-gapped or vendor-restricted build environment
   — that is the reason to revisit, not developer preference.

## Consequences

- **Effort moves, and grows.** The first milestone's frontend shrinks to a CLI subcommand. The
  product frontend becomes its own piece of work after it, sized for eight to twelve screens done
  properly, reusing the ~320 LOC of copied material and the nine interaction lessons. Estimates
  made for the prototype's five screens should not be quoted for the product.
- Node and Vite return to the build, for the frontend only. The Rust binary still builds with
  `cargo`; CI gains a frontend job.
- ADR 0002's conventions apply unchanged, and its "no tooling needed" table now describes only the
  prototype.
- The design work that was already done stands: nothing about upstream's portal becomes worth
  carrying, and the port list (~320 LOC copied, ~780 reimplemented, nine lessons) is unaffected by
  which framework renders it.

## Amendment 2026-10-05: the first milestone includes the product UI

The first milestone isn't called done, or handed to anyone to drive, until it is somewhat usable,
not only a CLI over working plumbing. So it now includes the product UI (this ADR's Svelte 5
SPA, with environment variables whose secrets stay with the proxy, a shell-init editor and a ports
panel with pinned forwards), the Tauri shell with an MSI installer and code signing, browser VS Code
in a Puddle-owned Tauri window, and an explicit "SSH not supported yet, use HTTPS" message for git
remotes over SSH.

What changes here:

- **Decision 3 is superseded.** The first milestone has a UI, and it is the product's own frontend:
  decision 1 (Svelte 5 SPA, served by axum and by Tauri) and decision 2 (generated contract, ADR
  0004) apply to it unchanged. The CLI `approve`/`deny` and the JSONL audit stream stay, as a
  second consumer and for scripted tests.
- **"The first milestone is a prototype that sets no precedent" no longer holds.** It is the first
  usable cut of the product, built in the product's architecture. The rule of this ADR still holds,
  and now matters more: design claims are argued from the shipped application's requirements, never
  from what was quickest to get something running. The build order keeps a CLI-driven plumbing
  stage first, but that stage is not the milestone.
- **The risk decision 3 guarded against**, prototype scaffolding becoming the product frontend by
  inertia, is handled by building no scaffolding UI at all: no server-rendered or throwaway screens
  at any stage.
- **Effort.** The product frontend, and the backend for its first screens, move from after the
  first milestone into it.

Unchanged: decision 4 (Dioxus as the road not taken, with its trigger) and the screen list above;
snapshots and extensions are still later (after v1, and only if users ask for them).

## Amendment 2026-10-06: written fresh, no Huddle material

Puddle is a personal project of its author, licensed GPL-3.0-or-later, and takes only ideas from
Huddle; no Huddle code is copied. Translating code counts as modifying it under copyright law, so a
Svelte reimplementation made with the Angular original open beside it would still derive from
Huddle.

What changes here:

- **The port list is dropped.** The ~320 LOC "copied material" (path-allowlist util, pie-menu
  model, icons, two pipes, theme tokens) and the ~780 LOC "reimplemented" components
  (`container-terminal`, `pie-menu`, `path-allowlist`, `confirm-modal`) are not used. Instead: own
  theme tokens, an MIT/ISC icon set such as Lucide, `Intl`-based formatting, and the pie menu and
  confirm modal built from the interaction lessons; the logo is Puddle's own.
- **Clean-room rule:** whoever builds these screens (human or agent) does not open upstream's
  Angular components, CSS or icon files for them. The same holds for the firewall rules engine and
  its store: they are built from Puddle's own [rules spec](../spec/rules.md) and tests, not from
  upstream's rules, database or test code.
- **The nine interaction lessons stand.** They are ideas, written in our own words.
- **Effort.** Writing these pieces fresh costs a few more days than porting would have.
