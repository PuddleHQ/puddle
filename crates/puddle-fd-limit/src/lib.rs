//! The open-file limit of a Puddle process.
//!
//! Every connection a process carries costs it one or two file descriptors (Puddle's relays hold
//! one per connection per side), and most systems start a process with a soft limit of 1024 while
//! the hard limit is far higher. A browser or a parallel `npm install` inside a workspace opens
//! hundreds of connections at once, so a process that stayed at 1024 would refuse connections
//! because of the sandbox. [`raise_open_file_limit`] lifts the soft limit to the hard limit once at
//! start and says what it got.
//!
//! On Windows there is nothing to raise: handles and sockets are not capped by a per-process
//! descriptor table the way POSIX file descriptors are, so every field is `None` (unlimited).
