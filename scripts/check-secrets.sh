# Secret scanning: gitleaks over the commits being checked, with the rules and the reviewed
# allowlist of fake test values in .gitleaks.toml. The gitleaks version is pinned in
# ci/gitleaks.sha256; install it with ci/fetch-gitleaks.sh <dir-on-PATH>.
# Usage: scripts/check-secrets.sh [--self-test]
#
# Scope (PUDDLE_SECRETS_SCOPE=all|head; unset means all when CI is set, else head):
#   head  HEAD's commits that its base does not have yet, which is what a push adds. The base is
#         $DIFF_BASE if it resolves (the same variable the diff-coverage gate uses), else
#         origin/develop; with neither, all of HEAD's history. A dirty commit on some other
#         local branch (another task's unlanded work) never matters.
#   all   every ref the clone has, gitleaks' own default. CI runs this, so a secret anywhere in
#         the full history, a removed one included, still fails there.
#
# --self-test proves the gate works, on throwaway repositories with the real configuration: a
# real-shaped token fails, a listed fake fixture passes, a real-shaped token in the fixture's
# own file still fails, a canary outside the listed paths fails, and each scope sees exactly the
# commits it should (a dirty side branch fails `all` and passes `head`).
#
# What it can't see: a secret with no recognisable shape (a bare password, a low-entropy value),
# one only in a stash, a file that never reached a commit, and in `head` scope a secret already
# in the base (the full CI scan covers it). A pass is a safety net, not proof.
