//! The stub DNS server.
//!
//! Tools that ignore the proxy settings resolve a name and connect to the answer. The stub answers
//! every address query for a name the host doesn't rule out with a stand-in address from
//! [`super::table`], and the capture rules send the connection to the agent, which sends the
//! name to the host's proxy like any other client of it.
//!
//! What the stub answers itself, without asking the host:
//!
//! - names that can never be a connect target ([`names::is_local_only`]): `NXDOMAIN`;
//! - `AAAA` and every other type that isn't forwarded: `NODATA` (so dual-stack clients use the
//!   stand-in at once), or `NXDOMAIN` when the name is already known not to exist;
//! - anything it already learned recently (the cache, for the time the host said).
//!
//! The rest is one lookup on a `resolve` stream ([`puddle_agent_proto::resolve`]); concurrent
//! queries for the same name share one lookup. The host decides with the sandbox's rules, and a
//! name it doesn't allow gets a stand-in without being looked up anywhere.
