# Runs a list of quality gates, the independent ones at the same time. Sourced by scripts/check.sh
# and scripts/check-sets-test.sh (which stubs the gates); the caller defines
#   run_gate <gate>     runs one gate; its exit status is the verdict
#   before_concurrent <gate>...   one-time setup before the streams start (npm ci)
# and may set `serial_gates`, the gates that run first, one at a time, stopping at the first failure.
#
# Streams (gate_stream): `rust` (compiles and tests; one cargo target dir, so these queue on its lock
# anyway), `node` (the UI chain; no cargo until ui-e2e starts its fixture) and `misc` (secrets, deny,
# advisories, notices: read-only scans). A gate that needs another gate's output waits for it (gate_needs):
# coverage runs the tests against the UI that `ui` builds. Gates keep their order within a stream; a
# failed gate stops its stream (as `set -e` stopped the old serial run) but not the others, so the
# first failure is reported with the whole picture and a retry of "the gates after it" covers all.
#
# Output: with one stream, or PUDDLE_CHECK_SERIAL=1, the gates run inline and print as they go. With
# several, each gate's output is kept and printed whole, under its own `==> <gate>` line, when the
# gate finishes, followed by `-- <gate>: ok, N s`. A failed gate prints `-- <gate>: FAILED` at once
# and its whole log at the end, in reverse run order, so the earliest failure in run order is the
# last `==> ` line, as it was when the run stopped there. The exit status is that gate's.
# On INT, TERM or HUP it stops every stream and all that they started (a process tree walk with ps).
