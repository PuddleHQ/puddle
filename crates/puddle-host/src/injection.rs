//!
//! A sandbox's CA is made when the sandbox starts and dropped when it stops: it lives in this

//!
//! The registry of a workspace's stand-ins is built from the store when it starts and kept for as
//! long as it runs; a change to its environment brings the registry and the decrypted hosts up to
//! date, while the guest's own environment is read at its next start.
