# Puts msb + libkrunfw for this host in <dest-dir>, for the VM tests (PUDDLE_VM_RUNTIME_DIR). Every
# downloaded file must match its SHA-256 pinned in ci/msb-runtime.sha256, and a source checkout its
# pinned commit.
# Usage: ci/fetch-msb.sh [<tag>] <dest-dir>     tag defaults to the SDK's fork tag (ci/msb-tag.sh)
#        ci/fetch-msb.sh --pinned <tag> <name>  prints that pin (see `pinned`)

#   fork tag v<release>-puddle.N (TijsVK/microsandbox):
#     Windows: the release's msb-windows-x86_64.exe and libkrunfw-windows-x86_64.dll, installed as
#              msb.exe + libkrunfw.dll.
#     Linux:   the release's msb-linux-x86_64 and libkrunfw-linux-x86_64.so (the fork's release job
#              builds msb from the tag with the release's own agentd embedded), installed as msb and as
#              libkrunfw.so.5 plus a copy under the versioned name msb looks for beside itself
#              (libkrunfw.so.<version>, pinned in ci/msb-runtime.sha256). A tag whose release has
#              no Linux msb pinned (older releases, or an asset the release job failed to make) is
#              built from the tag's source instead (commit pinned) with the guest agent embedded: the
#              release's own agentd-x86_64 when the tag has one pinned (the fork builds it from the
#              same source as msb, and the host and guest must agree on their limits), else
#              upstream's; libkrunfw from upstream's release v<release> (the fork keeps upstream's
#              firmware). That build needs cargo and libcap-ng-dev and takes ~10 min cold;
#              MSB_BUILD_DIR (default <dest-dir>/../msb-build) holds the checkout, its target dir
#              and the result msb-<commit>, which is reused when present (a CI cache keeps only that
#              file).
#   upstream tag v<release> (superradcompany/microsandbox): the release archive for this host.
# Works in Linux sh and in Git Bash on Windows. Network failures are retried (infrastructure) and each retry is printed; a checksum mismatch never is.
