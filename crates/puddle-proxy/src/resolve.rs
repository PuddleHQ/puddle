//! Name lookups from the guest's stub DNS (the `resolve` stream).
//!
//! Clients that ignore proxy settings resolve a name and connect to the answer, which the guest's
//! network rules redirect to the agent. The stub answers every address query with a stand-in
//! address and asks the host first, so the one thing it must learn is whether the name exists.
//! The host decides with the workspace's rules. An address lookup never writes a pending row: the
//! connect that follows is what produces the deny or pending row. The one exception is `SRV` (below).
//!
//! - **Not allowed** (no rule, or a deny): a stand-in with **no lookup at all**. DNS carries nothing
//!   out, and a guest asking for a million random names causes no resolver traffic.
//! - **Blocked by itself** (a toggle that is off, one of puddle's endpoints): a stand-in too; the
//!   connect says which toggle would allow it.
//! - **Allowed**: the name is resolved once here. An answer means a stand-in; "no such name" means
//!   `NXDOMAIN`, unless the company proxy is in the route and may resolve it where the host can't
//!   (some networks resolve internet names only at the proxy): then a stand-in, and the proxy
//!   decides when the connect arrives.
//! - **`SRV`, `TXT`, `MX`** are looked up for allowed names only; for any other name the answer is
//!   `NODATA`. An `SRV` query for a name **no rule matches** also raises one pending request for
//!   the base name (deduplicated like any other), because a client that starts with `SRV`
//!   (`mongodb+srv://`) would otherwise fail without the user ever seeing it. A denied name raises
//!   nothing, and neither do `TXT` and `MX`. The leading service labels of an `SRV` name (`_mongodb._tcp.`) are not part of what
//!   the rules match: `_mongodb._tcp.db.example.net` is decided as `db.example.net`.
//!
//! The answer to an address query never contains an address of the host's: only the stand-in the
//! guest allocates itself.
