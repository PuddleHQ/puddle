//! The injector for one workspace: what happens to each request on a decrypted Git host.
//!
//! In order, for a request that reads as a Git request (anything else passes through untouched):
//!
//! 1. A path that names a repository in more than one way is refused (`400`).
//! 2. The workspace's repository table is applied: a push to a repository without Push, or, when
//!    the workspace asks for it, a fetch from one without Pull, is refused (`403`) with a one-line
//!    message and an event the UI turns into an "add it" notice. This holds whoever supplies the
//!    credential.
//! 3. A request that carries its own `Authorization` goes out as it is: never replaced, never
//!    dropped, and a `401` to it is the server's answer.
//! 4. Otherwise the identity that covers the repository's owner supplies the credential. No
//!    covering identity: the request goes out without one and the server's `401` is its answer (an
//!    event tells the user no identity covers the owner, once the workspace's own tool has had a
//!    moment to retry with a credential it holds). A
//!    source that cannot supply the secret: `502` (the cache the secret is read through raises the
//!    sign-in notice). A `401` to the credential Puddle added becomes a `403` and a sign-in notice:
//!    the workspace holds no credential to answer it with.
