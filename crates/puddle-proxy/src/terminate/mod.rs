//! TLS termination for the hosts a workspace has a credential for.
//!
//! Almost every connection through the proxy is spliced: the guest and the real server talk TLS
//! to each other and Puddle sees only the name. A *bound* host is the exception, so that a
//! credential can be added to the request without ever entering the workspace. For those hosts, and
//! only those, the proxy is the TLS server the guest sees (with a certificate from the
//! workspace's own CA, `puddle-ca`) and a verifying TLS client to the real server.
//!
//! A connection is terminated only when all of these hold; otherwise it is spliced exactly as
//! before:
//!
//! - the workspace has a [`Termination`] (a [`TerminationSet`], its CA and an [`Injector`]);
//! - the guest asked for a *name* (an IP literal never matches) in the set;
//! - the port is 443.
//!
//! The rules, the address guard and the IP rules run first and are unchanged: terminating a host
//! never allows it.
//!
//! On a terminated connection:
//!
//! - **Order**: the guest's `ClientHello` is read first and its name checked; a client that sends
//!   another name, an IP address or none gets a TLS alert and the connection ends with the audit
//!   reason `sni_mismatch`, and nothing is sent upstream. Then the real server is connected to,
//!   offering the protocols the guest offered (`h2`, `http/1.1`), and the guest is offered what the
//!   server chose. A server that cannot be used (a certificate that is not accepted) does not stop
//!   the guest's handshake: the first request is answered with the reason.
//! - **Guest leg**: a rustls server whose one certificate is the leaf for the `CONNECT` host.
//!   HTTP/1.1 is read with the strict parser the plain-HTTP path uses, one request at a time (a
//!   pipelined request is decided on its own) and rebuilt before it is sent. HTTP/2 is served by
//!   hyper, one request per stream, with the same checks (`Host`/`:authority`, target, framing)
//!   and limits of its own (streams, header list, resets, header-read time).
//!   A client that refuses the certificate (it does not trust the workspace's CA) is recorded with
//!   the audit reason `guest_tls_rejected`; the rule's decision stands, since Puddle blocked nothing.
//! - **Requests**: a request for another host (`Host`, `:authority` or an absolute target) is
//!   `421`; an ambiguous one is `400`. The [`Injector`] is asked the same way on both versions.
//! - **Upstream leg**: one connection per guest connection, never shared, verified against the
//!   platform's roots plus the corporate roots with the host's clock. A certificate that is not
//!   accepted is a `502` that names the reason, and no request byte, and no credential, is sent.
//!   The [`Injector`] is asked only after the connection is verified. HTTP/2 to the server carries
//!   every stream of an HTTP/2 guest; an HTTP/2 guest talking to an HTTP/1.1 server uses a small
//!   pool of HTTP/1.1 connections owned by that guest connection.
//! - **Stand-ins**: after the injector has decided, the workspace's [`StandIns`] are swapped for
//!   their real values in the header values of the request, toward the hosts each is for, on both
//!   HTTP versions.
//! - **Responses**: framed by an HTTP client library, then rebuilt for the guest, trailers
//!   included. Redirects are passed through, never followed. A `401` is replaced by the
//!   injector's own refusal when the injector added the request's credential ([`Unauthorized`]);
//!   otherwise it is the server's answer like any other. The HTTP/3 entries of `Alt-Svc` are
//!   removed on both HTTP versions: a workspace has no UDP path, so a client would only try
//!   HTTP/3 and fail.
//! - **WebSocket**: HTTP/1.1 `Upgrade` and HTTP/2 extended `CONNECT` (RFC 8441) are checked and
//!   injected like any request; once the server agrees, the two connections are a byte pipe.
