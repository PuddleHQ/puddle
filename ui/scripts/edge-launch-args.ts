// The launch switches the Windows e2e project gives the installed Edge.
//
// From Windows 11 22H2 on, Chromium asks Windows for a random local port for each connection it
// opens (`TcpPortRandomizationWin`, on by default). With the default pool of 16 384 dynamic ports
// and the thousands of short loopback connections a full e2e run opens, Windows now and then
// answers such a `connect()` at once with error 10055 (no buffer space), Chromium reports it as
// `net::ERR_NO_BUFFER_SPACE`, and the page being loaded never starts: about one full run in four.
// With the feature off, Windows picks the port itself and no run failed that way.
//
// Playwright passes its own `--disable-features` list, and Chromium reads only the last such
// switch, so that list is repeated here with the one feature added.
//
// A stopgap: take the switch out when a full run of the installed Edge no longer fails that way
// without it (try that after each Edge or Playwright update; the test beside this file already
// fails on a Playwright update).
