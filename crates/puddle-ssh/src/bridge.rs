//! `puddle ssh-bridge`: relays `ssh`'s stdio to a sandbox's SSH endpoint (it is the
//! `ProxyCommand`).
//!
//! Rules, the same on Windows and Unix:
//!
//! | Event | What the bridge does |
//! |---|---|
//! | client input ends (EOF, or a read error) | half-closes the endpoint (Unix; a no-op on a Windows pipe, see below) and **keeps relaying** the server's output |
//! | the server's output ends | flushes and closes the client output, and ends: the session is over, whatever the input still does |
//! | writing to the client fails (`ssh` is gone) | ends; dropping the connection closes it, which the server sees |
//! | writing to the server fails | stops sending; ends once the server's output ends |
//! | the endpoint doesn't say [`HELLO`] within [`HELLO_TIMEOUT`] | [`BridgeError::NoAnswer`]: never wait forever on something that isn't serving |
//! | the endpoint refuses the client | [`BridgeError::Refused`] with the reason, nothing written to the client |
//!
//! Why the server's EOF ends everything: SSH has no transport half-close (the server ends a
//! session by closing), a Windows pipe's EOF is a full close anyway, and `ssh` may keep the
//! bridge's stdin open after the connection is gone.
//!
//! **Windows named pipes can't half-close**: after the client's input ends, the server
//! only learns of it through SSH itself (`DISCONNECT`, channel EOF), never from the stream.
//! Nothing in SSH needs more.
