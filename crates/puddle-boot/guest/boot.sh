# Puddle's boot hook. Puddle runs it as root through the runtime's
# exec after every create and every start, and serves no SSH or exec to anyone until it exits 0.
#
#   /bin/sh /puddle/boot.sh [ENTRYPOINT CMD...] < plan
#
# The plan on stdin comes from puddle-boot (crates/puddle-boot/src/plan.rs): a shell fragment
# that only calls the puddle_* functions below, with every value quoted there. The arguments, if
# any, are the image's ENTRYPOINT + CMD, chained after setup. POSIX sh (dash, bash, busybox
# ash). Idempotent: running it again converges on the same files and starts nothing twice.
#
# Exit status: 0 ready; 1 a step failed; 2 bad usage or plan. Errors go to stderr, one line
# starting with "puddle-boot: error:"; progress goes to stdout and /run/puddle/boot.log.
#
# PUDDLE_ROOT is for the unit tests only (Puddle always passes it empty): it relocates every file
# the hook reads or writes, so the tests run it against a fake root. Process checks use the live
# /proc either way.
