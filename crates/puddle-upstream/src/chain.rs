//! Connecting through the route [`Discovery`] picked: the hops in order, the `CONNECT`
//! and absolute-form exchanges with a proxy, and the `407` loop driven by [`ProxyAuth`].
//!
//! The caller (the workspace proxy, the pull proxy, a host-side client) has already decided that
//! the connection may happen: the rules said yes and the resolved addresses passed the guard.
//! [`Chain`] only decides *how* to reach the destination, and keeps that decision from widening
//! what was checked:
//!
//! - a `DIRECT` hop connects only to an address in [`Request::checked`], never to a name;
//! - a proxy hop is told the destination **name** only when the caller says every address the
//!   name resolved to passed ([`Request::name_ok`]) or the name could not be resolved here at all
//!   (the company's proxy does the resolving, as in networks without external DNS). Otherwise it
//!   is sent a checked **address**, so a name that also resolves to a denied address cannot make
//!   the proxy connect there.
//!
//! Hop order and fallback follow PAC rules: a hop that cannot be reached (connect error, timeout,
//! closed or garbled answer) is reported to [`Discovery::report_failure`] and the next hop is
//! tried. A proxy that answers (`403`, `407` it cannot satisfy, `5xx`) ends the attempt: browsers
//! do not fail over on an answer, and silently going `DIRECT` after a refusal would bypass the
//! company's policy.
