# Puddle

Rubber ducks welcome.

Puddle runs each devcontainer workspace in its own microVM on Windows (Linux hosts from v1), with
Puddle's own proxy as the only way out of the VM. Outbound connections go to domains you allowed,
per workspace or globally; anything else waits in an approval inbox until you allow or deny it. It
is a native Rust program with a Tauri desktop app, built and tested on Windows and Linux, and builds
on [microsandbox](https://github.com/superradcompany/microsandbox) for the microVMs.

The idea follows [Huddle](https://github.com/infosupport/huddle); Puddle is written from scratch and
shares no code with it.

**Status:** early development, no release yet. The Cargo workspace and its quality gates are in
place; product code is being written.

## Branches

- `develop`: where work happens. Open pull requests against it.
- `main`: released versions only.

## Development

Rust, pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (rustup installs it on first use). Tools for the gates:
`cargo install --locked cargo-nextest cargo-llvm-cov cargo-deny typos-cli` (or `cargo binstall`).

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # once per clone: fast gates on commit, the pre-push set on push
scripts/check.sh                      # every gate CI runs (the pre-push set plus UI e2e): fmt, typos, SPDX, clippy, deny, docs, tests + coverage
cargo nextest run                     # tests only
cargo run -p puddle -- --version
```
