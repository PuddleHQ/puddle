//! The kill-on-close job object Puddle and every process it starts run in (Windows).
//!
//! [`contain_this_process`] creates one job with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`, puts the
//! current process in it, and keeps the only handle until the process ends. Children inherit
//! the job, msb's VMM processes included (the SDK starts them without
//! `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` and adds them to a nested per-sandbox job of its own), and the
//! job doesn't allow breakaway. When Puddle ends in any way, `TerminateProcess` included, the
//! handle closes and Windows kills everything left in the job.
//!
//! This is the one place to add job limits (UI restrictions, a process count) for a
//! sandbox-escape review. On Linux it does nothing: msb's parent watchdog stops the VMs.
