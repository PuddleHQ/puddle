//! Reconcile at start: clean up after a Puddle that died without its shutdown.
//!
//! Puddle-owned means: a sandbox the runtime lists with [`SandboxInfo::puddle_owned`] (msb: the
//! owner label) **and** a valid [`SandboxName`]; a stale directory with a valid [`SandboxName`]
//! (it has no record that could carry the label; Puddle's msb home is private); a volume
//! named `ws-<workspace id>`. Everything else is foreign and only reported.
//!
//! A workspace volume holds work that may exist nowhere else, so reconcile removes one only when
//! the inventory names it as a create that never finished. A `ws-*` volume the inventory doesn't
//! know is kept and reported ([`ReconcileReport::unknown_volumes`]): a missing or outdated list
//! of workspaces must never cost a workspace its data (principle 7, "your work is never lost by
//! accident").
//!
//! A Puddle-owned maintenance sandbox (`m--<workspace id>`) only lives while Puddle checks
//! or trims a workspace, so one found at start is always a leftover: it is stopped and removed
//! even if the inventory lists it. After reconcile, [`adopt_workspaces`] rebuilds the workspace
//! holder registry (it lives in memory) from the inventory.
