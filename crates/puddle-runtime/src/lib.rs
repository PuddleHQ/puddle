//! The msb runtime Puddle ships with: where it lives, the environment that makes the SDK use
//! it and nothing else, and the check that it is exactly the version this build was made for.
//!
//! Puddle never uses a user's own msb. At startup it:
//!
//! 1. builds a [`RuntimeLayout`]: the bundled runtime folder (next to `puddle.exe`) and Puddle's
//!    private `MSB_HOME`, so images and volumes never mix with a user's own msb;
//! 2. opens the runtime with [`BundledRuntime::open`], which refuses a missing `msb` binary or one
//!    whose embedded version isn't exactly [`BUILT_FOR`] (both versions named in the error);
//! 3. gives the SDK the runtime and home as arguments (`puddle-compute-msb`), so the process
//!    environment is never changed and a user's `MSB_*` variables are ignored. [`RuntimeEnv`] is the
//!    same rule for a child [`std::process::Command`] Puddle starts itself: it removes **every**
//!    `MSB_*` variable the user set (incl. `MSB_LIBKRUNFW_PATH`, `MSB_AGENTD_PATH`, `MSB_BACKEND`),
//!    then sets `MSB_PATH`, `MSB_HOME` and `MSB_CONFIG_PATH`;
//!
//! Image pulls go through Puddle's pull proxy by an explicit setting on the registry client
//! (`microsandbox_image::RegistryBuilder::proxy`, set from `puddle-compute-msb`'s
//! `MsbConfig::with_registry_proxy`), not through the environment: the per-run token never
//! enters the process environment, so no child process inherits it.
//!
//! | Item | What |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`BUILT_FOR`], [`RuntimeVersion`] | the pinned `<release>-puddle.N` and its parser |
//! | [`read_embedded_version`] | the version msb embeds in its binary (`.msbver`), read without running it |
//! | [`check_version`], [`VersionStatus`], [`DevOverride`] | the exact-match rule and the dev-only escape hatch |
//! | [`RuntimeLayout`], [`RuntimeEnv`], [`BundledRuntime`] | paths, environment, the opened runtime |
//! | [`HostOs`], [`RuntimeFiles`], [`GuestArch`] | the per-OS file-name table and the guest architecture (agent target): the only place `msb.exe`, `libkrunfw.dll` and friends are spelled |
//! | [`RuntimeError`] | every way the runtime can be unusable |
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - `dev-override`: honours `PUDDLE_DEV_ANY_RUNTIME=1` ([`DevOverride`]). Off by default; a
//!   release build with it on doesn't compile, and a test fails if any workspace crate enables it.
